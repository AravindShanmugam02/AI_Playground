# AI Playground
## About Project
An experimental project where various AI concepts and knowledge are being implemented and explored using Unity engine and C#.
## Technical Details
### $${\textsf{\color{lime}AI Pathfinding - Single-layer Grid}}$$
For distance calculation between tiles used Manhattan method as it works good with grid.</br>
#### $${\textsf{\color{orange}A*}}$$
Used 3 different heuristics, namely **GCost**, **HCost**, **FCost**, to find the best path.</br>

#### $${\textsf{\color{orange}Dijkstra}}$$
Used **GCost** as heuristics to find the best path.</br>

## Area of Improvements
- [ ] To clear up the node colours when algorithm is set to None.</br>
- [ ] To try distance calculation using Euclidean method.</br>
